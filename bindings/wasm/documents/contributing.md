## Documentation

### Terminology

These are general guidelines, not hard rules.  The aim of this section is to encourage consistent documentation, not to institute brand standards.

* When referring to the library, manifold should generally be lowercase.  Manifold can be capitalized when grammatically correct, for example at the start of a sentence.  If unclear, `manifold` can be marked up as code to distinguish it from the manifold property.
* The Manifold class should generally be capitalized.  Where appropriate, it can be linked directly to the {@link manifold.Manifold | Manifold} class documentation.
* ManifoldCAD should be capitalized.  [ManifoldCAD.org](https://manifoldcad.org) should be a link.
