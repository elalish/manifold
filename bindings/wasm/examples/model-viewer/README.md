Manifold has full support for arbitrary vertex properties, and also has IDs that make it easy to keep track of materials and what surfaces belong to what input objects or faces.  This example is a simple demonstration of combining objects with unique textures.  The final result is shown using [\<model-viewer\>](https://modelviewer.dev/).
