/** @defgroup Samples
 * @brief Examples of usage and interesting designs
 *
 * These are mostly 3D-printable designs I've invented over the years,
 * translated from their original OpenSCAD to C++ to demonstrate the usage of
 * this library. You can find the originals here:
 * http://www.thingiverse.com/emmett These also each have tests you can find in
 * test/samples_test.cpp, which have nice parameter choices for making some of
 * the specific designs I print. While the source code is under the Apache
 * License above, I license all of my designs (the output of those tests if you
 * uncomment the export lines) under CC-BY-SA:
 * https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/, which means you're welcome
 * to print and sell them, so long as you attribute the design to Emmett Lalish
 * and share any derivative works under the same license.
