Description: Geometry library for triangle mesh operations
 Manifold is a geometry library dedicated to creating and operating on
 manifold triangle meshes. A manifold mesh is a mesh that represents a solid
 object, and so is very important in manufacturing, CAD, structural analysis,
 etc.
 .
 The library provides guaranteed manifold output with fast, robust mesh
 Boolean operations. It supports arbitrary vertex properties and enables
 mapping of materials for rendering use-cases. The library makes extensive
 use of parallelization through TBB for performance.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.
