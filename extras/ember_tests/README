The paper EMBER: Exact Mesh Boolean via Efficient & Robust
Local Arrangments (see https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3528223.3530181)
has supplemental material that describes 1000 tests using meshes
from the Thinki10K dataset (see https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/)

The code and files here are for testing Manifold on the same tests.

man_bench is a binary that reads two .stl files and has corresponding
transform arguments. It converts those to MeshGL, then to Manifold,
then runs a boolean difference, and converts the result back to MeshGL.
It times the total time take to do this (not including loading the
stl files into MeshGL format), and appends a line to a benchmarks.csv
file with the argument and timing information.
The Makefile probably needs tweaking (sorry, didn't make a CMakefile).

testfiles/README_TESTIFLES explains how to get the testfiles needed
(they are too large to put into git).

do_ember_tests.py reads the description of the files and transforms
from the supplemental material of the Ember paper, and executes
man_bench on each pair.  This creates a benchmark.csv file (remember
to remove that file again if you want a clean new run of data).

analyze_ember_tests.py reads the benchmark.csv file and calculates
statistics and does a plot.

bug-case.json is a single test case that takes abnormally long.

m3max_benchmarks.csv is the benchmarks file gotten by running on my
Macbook Pro M3 Max (12 performance cores, 4 efficiency cores).
