  <p>This example demonstrates interop between Manifold and Three.js with minimal code - please open dev tools to
    inspect the source. Here we generate two multi-material Three.js meshes and convert them to Manifolds while building
    a mapping from material to Manifold ID. Then Boolean operations are performed on the Manifolds and the result is
    converted back to a Three.js mesh using the material mapping. The input cube has half red faces and half
    normal-shaded, while the icosahedron has half blue faces and half normal-shaded. The resulting mesh has three
    materials, since one (normal-shaded) was common between the input models.</p>
  <p>A slightly more complex example involving our library for GLTF import/export and &lt;model-viewer&gt; can be found
